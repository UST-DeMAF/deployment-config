# Kubernetes Deployment Readme

This readme addresses the features, issues, and future work of the kubernetes deployment, as the deployment is still work in progress.

## Features

* The Deployment has all the features and functionality for the end user as if it was deployed locally.

## Issues

* The services are assigned statically to specific nodes, so that the file access works.

## Future Work

* Use DB for the local saved files to fix statically assigned nodes.
* Make the plugins more scalable.
